# What's for lunch?

This is a simple web application to fight the monotony of lunch options in downtown Des Moines. It takes a dataset of restaurants and randomly suggests a type of cuisine along with places serving that cuisine.

## Try it out

- [dmlunch.com](http://dmlunch.com/)
- [broox.github.io/whats-for-lunch/](https://broox.github.io/whats-for-lunch/)

## Missing your favorite restaurant?

- Feel free to make suggestions by clicking the little edit/pencil icon on the top of [the datafile](https://github.com/broox/whats-for-lunch/blob/master/data/restaurants.yml)

## Want to run locally?

- First run `npm install`
- Then start the server via: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
- And now browse to: [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Possible enhancements

- keep track of previous suggestions so as to not suggest the same thing twice in a row
- allow user to decide whether they want to stay in the sidewalk, go outside, or either
- allow option for Carry-out vs Dine-in
- allow option for whether or not alcohol is served
- display food court options for variety (this could just be considered a venue... maybe)
- pull data from some outside API
- use browserify + gulp to concatenate and minify js
